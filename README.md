# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

This challenge was taken from the Frontend Mentor page. The goal is to build an evaluation page, where users
come across a questionnaire from 1 to 5, for you to evaluate.
I made some aesthetic changes to the original project, but kept all the features.

With this challenge, I was able to continue evolving and consolidating my knowledge in front-end tools: CSS, HTML and JavaScript. Of them, JS is the biggest challenge right now, and I'm looking to get to know DOM manipulation better.
